# Module 11: MCMC II for Infectious Diseases

Week 2, Session 4, Wednesday 1:30 PM - Friday 5:00 PM: Wed Jul 20 to Fri Jul 22


This module continues on from Module 4 by looking in detail at
practical implementation issues for MCMC methods when applied to data
from infectious disease outbreaks. The main focus will be towards
inference for the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model. Topics
include parameterisation, methods for improving convergence, assessing
MCMC output, and data augmentation methods. Programming will be
carried out in R. The course assumes all the material in Module 7. The
material from Module 2 or 5 would be helpful, but not required.
