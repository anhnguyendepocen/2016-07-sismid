Different forecast philosophies

- Biases on search engine results and auto complete in the data
- CDC data
- twitter
- spurious correlation (zombies ~ flu)

Realism spectrum:
- Homogeneous mixing
- social structure
- contact network models
- multi-scale models
- agent based models

- simple epidemic models
  - actual disease
  - assumptions
	- constant population
	- no latency
	- only crucial element: s-i interaction
	  - disregard age/sex/occupation/social status/wealth contacts/etc...
	- no hospitals, no medicines
	- no behavioral change

prob of recover = inverse of avg rate infectious period

sir model: s + i -> 2i

transmission rate, x, effective number of contacts per unit time: beta

x, proportion of contacts infectious I / N

using a smothing algorithm vs a model fit

New flu trends use ensoble models on historic data to do real-time predictions.
