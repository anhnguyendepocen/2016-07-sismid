# Exercice 1

Go through each of the functions in the file households.R and make sure that you understand what is going on.

```{r}
if (interactive()) {
    hh <- 'sismid_11-mcmc2_for_infectious_diseases/lab-04_household/households.R'
} else {
    hh <- 'households.R'
}

source(hh)
```


# Exercice 2

Write a function in R which computes the log-likelihood of the data given the parameters p
and Î± assuming that the infectious period is constant and of length one unit.

```{r}
##   No.of.Cases No.of.Households
## 1           0               29
## 2           1                9
## 3           2                2
## 4           3                2

log_liklihood <- function(alpha, p, c = 1) {
    29 * log(compute.marginal.prob(k = 0, n = 3, c = c, alpha = alpha, p = p)) +
        9 * log(compute.marginal.prob(k = 1, n = 3, c = c, alpha = alpha, p = p)) +
        2 * log(compute.marginal.prob(k = 2, n = 3, c = c, alpha = alpha, p = p)) +
        2 * log(compute.marginal.prob(k = 3, n = 3, c = c, alpha = alpha, p = p))
}
```


```{r}
log_liklihood(alpha = 0, p = 0.5)
```

#  Exercice 3

```{r}
init <- function(data, beta){
    fs <- sum(data$removal != Inf)
    N <- nrow(data)
    
    rbeta(N, 1, 1)
}
```
